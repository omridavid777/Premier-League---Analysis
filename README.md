# Premier-League---Analysis


**Introduction**
This project analyzes Premier League data to uncover scoring patterns and team performance trends between August 2024 and January 2025. The goal was to understand team dominance, compare home and away performances, and identify insights that can be used for predictions or further analysis

---

**Project Objectives**
1. Identify teams leading in goal scoring.  
2. Compare home vs. away performance for each team.  
3. Highlight teams with balanced or extreme scoring patterns.  
4. Provide actionable insights for advanced analysis or predictions.

**Data Source**
The data was obtained from a structured CSV file containing match results, including:  
- Team names.  
- Home and away goals.  
- Match outcomes.  

---
**Tools and Technologies**
- SQL: Data cleaning, exploration, and calculations.  
- Excel: Data visualization using charts and graphs.  

---

**Methodology**
1. Data import and validation in SQL.  
2. Calculation of key metrics:
   - Total goals scored by each team (home and away).  
   - Average goals per game.  
3. Visualization in Excel to identify patterns and trends.  

---

**Key Insights**
1. Liverpool (45) and *Tottenham (41) lead the league in total goals scored.  
   - Liverpool scored more away goals.  
   - Tottenham scored more home goals.  
2. Brentford (26) scored the most home goals but struggled away (only 6 goals).  
3. Southampton (12)* has the lowest total goals, with weak performances both home and away.  
4. Teams like Leicester showed balance, with equal home and away goals (11 each).

**Future Work**
This project can be expanded to include:  
1. Analysis of defensive performance (goals conceded).  
2. Comparing trends across multiple seasons.  
3. Player-level analysis to assess individual contributions.  
4. Predictive modeling for future match outcomes.

**How to Use the Project**
1. Download the dataset (if included).  
2. Review the SQL scripts for data analysis.  
3. Use the Excel file to explore visualizations.  
4. Build upon the insights for further analysis or predictions.
